We can do a simple naive look at the means of the test score of each combination of TrDs
```{r}
#library(emmeans)
#setwd("~/SeminarDataScience/semimar-data-sci/Coursework-B/RQ-3")
means = aggregate(score~TrD1+TrD2+TrD3+TrD4+TrD5+TrD6+TrD7+TrD8,d,mean)


```

We can look at which combination of training sets achieves the maximum test score.
```{r}
which.max(aggregate(score~TrD1+TrD2+TrD3+TrD4+TrD5+TrD6+TrD7+TrD8,d,mean)$score)
means[140,]
```


We can also observe the single Training data set models and see how they perform
```{r}
t1 = d[d$TrD1 == 1 & d$model=="S", ]
mean(t1$score)
t2 = d[d$TrD2 == 1 & d$model=="S", ]
mean(t2$score)
t3 = d[d$TrD3 == 1 & d$model=="S", ]
mean(t3$score)
t4 = d[d$TrD4 == 1 & d$model=="S", ]
mean(t4$score)
t5 = d[d$TrD5 == 1 & d$model=="S", ]
mean(t5$score)
t6 = d[d$TrD6 == 1 & d$model=="S", ]
mean(t6$score)
t7 = d[d$TrD7 == 1 & d$model=="S", ]
mean(t7$score)
t8 = d[d$TrD8 == 1 & d$model=="S", ]
mean(t8$score)


sub= subset(d,model=="S")
#m = lm(score ~ model+TrD1+TrD2, sub)
#summary(m)
#confint(m)

#t1 = d[d$TrD1 == 1 & d$model=="S", ]
```
