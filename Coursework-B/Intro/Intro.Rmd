# Introduction

To read the data and understand the distribution of observations we did the following.
```{r}
library('ggplot2')
library('emmeans')
data = read.csv('../data/data.csv')
table(data$model, data$TeD)
```



```{r}
plot(data$model, data$score, main="Model Scores", xlab='models', ylab='score')
```
 We see that models that are trained/refined partwise in transferlearning perform better on average than the baselines. 


```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(score)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) + facet_wrap(~model)
```
