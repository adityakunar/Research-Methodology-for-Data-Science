# Instructions

## Scripting

1. You may create your individual R Projects in the directors for each Part and Question.
2. Write a single R script for your particular task/sub-task.
3. You can generate a markdown using: 
   ```rmarkdown::render(input = "<filename>", clean = F)```



## Reporting

1. Copy the template into the report markdown ```Report-<task number>-<subtask number>.md``` which has already been created for you.
2. You may want to extract `./Submission/(Old)-Submission.zip`. 
   1. There is a `.gitignore` in place so the contents wont be normally added to the commit. 
   2. Do not commit these files to the repository.
3. Fill in the sections from the generated markdown as you see fit. 
4. You can refer to the old report in the extracted `./Submission/(Old)-Submission/Final-Report.Rmd` for adding earlier sections.
5. *Do not add any content to `./Submission/Final-Report.md` unless your work in the independent has been reviewed by another group member*
